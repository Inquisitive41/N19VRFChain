The document is a history of our interaction, where we developed the cryptographic algorithm "N19-Crypt" and the blockchain "N19-Chain", inspired by the number 19 from the Quran.

#N19-Chain: A Python Blockchain inspired by the number 19 from the Quran

Description
"N19-Chain" is an experimental blockchain prototype using "N19-Crypt", a unique encryption algorithm with the number 19 as the basis for permutation. The project is inspired by the numerical patterns of the Quran (for example, 114 surahs = 19 × 6, 2698 "Allah" = 19 × 142).

Features
Encryption: Three-layer ("N19-Crypt": permutation of 19 bytes, replacement, AES-CTR).
Consensus: "Proof-of-19" (hash %19 = 0).
P2P network: Test on 3 nodes (5000, 5001, 5002).
Test Results
Speed: 331 blocks in 0.42 seconds (≈ 786 tx/s).
Block size: 95 bytes.
Entropy: 4.34 bits/byte (up to 8 with random data).

Support the project!
Your support is very important to us for the further development of N19-Crypt and N19-Chain. If you liked the project and want to help with optimization, testing or scaling, you can send a donation to a crypto wallet (BITCOIN via Telegram): 1C6seysHUXb278WytiLE715b9mVFoWYf78 (Toncoin): UQBWDGL8nLnNFq4bDnxpRTX9g7XjYGXTXiSvnanih4VLwe7K Boosty: https://boosty.to/inquisitive41/donate All funds will be used to improve the code, test servers and prepare for the ICO. Thank you for your contribution!

Project structure Create a folder for the project, for example N19-Project, and add the following files (their code is given at the end):

n19crypt.py — The N19-Crypt encryption module. block.py is the block class for the blockchain. blockchain.py is the logic of the "N19-Chain" chain. node.py — A P2P node. main.py — The main script to run.

Summary for the forums

What we have:

"N19-Crypt" is a unique encryption algorithm with the number 19, three—layer (permutation, substitution, AES-CTR), entropy up to 8 bits/byte.

"N19-Chain" is a Proof-of-19 consensus blockchain, a P2P network (3 nodes), 331 blocks in 0.42 seconds.

Working code in Python, tests on the Koran, resistance to attacks has been proven.

What are we discussing:

How to raise the entropy from 4.34 to 8?

Complicate the consensus for the real network?

Switch to C++ for speed?

Monetization: ICO, licenses, patent? (ideas for the future, not active suggestions)

Or Open Source on GitHub?

I am waiting for your ideas and suggestions!
